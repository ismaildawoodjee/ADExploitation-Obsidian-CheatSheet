**WHAT IS THIS?:**

The VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) is a Windows service that allows users to create snapshots or backups of their data at a specific point in time. Attackers can abuse this service to access and copy sensitive data, even if it is currently being used or locked by another process.

If you have local administrator access on a machine, try to list shadow copies, it's an easy way for Domain Escalation.

---

- List shadow copies using `vssadmin` (Needs Admnistrator Access):
```powershell
vssadmin list shadows
```
- List shadow copies using `diskshadow`:
```powershell
diskshadow list shadows all
```
- Make a symlink to the shadow copy and access it:
```powershell
mklink /d c:\shadowcopy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\
```

1. You can dump the backup'ed SAM database and harvest credentials.
2. Look for DPAPI stored creds and decrypt them.
3. Access backup'ed sensitive files.
