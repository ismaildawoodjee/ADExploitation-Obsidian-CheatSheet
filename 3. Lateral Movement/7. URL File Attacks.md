- Put these files in a writeable share. 
- The victim only has to open the file explorer and navigate to the share.
- **NOTE:** That the file doesn't need to be opened or the user to interact with it, but it must be on the top of the file system (file system root) or just visible in the windows explorer window in order to be rendered. Use `responder` to capture the hashes.
- **Also NOTE:** `.scf` file attacks won't work on the latest versions of Windows.
